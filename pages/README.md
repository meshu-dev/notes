# DevDocs

After doing some research into static site generators and finding out that vuepress is a pretty good tool for documentation generation I decided to give it a try and use it for my personal developer notes instead of writing up quick notes in a txt file.

At first I thought it was a requirement to prrogram in VueJS to generate documentation but it turns out it's optional, you can pretty much get away with simply creating the markdown files for the documentation pages and using the vuepress build command to generate the documentation website.

## Markdown editor

After checking out some online markdown editors I've choosen Dillinger as it shows a markdown code column along with a preview column so you can see what your changes as you code.
