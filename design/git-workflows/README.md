# Git workflows

A git workflow is an agreed method within a team of how to use Git to commit code to a repository.

## Centralised workflow

- Ideal for teams familiar with Subversion (SVN).
- A single repository (master) is used where team members directly push commits to.
- No pull requests or forks wouldn't be used.

## Feature branch workflow

- A repository seperate from master (e.g. develop) is where code is pushed by team members.
- Master branch won't have broken code as it would be detected in the develop repository first.

## Gitflow workflow

- Same as feature branch workflow

## Forking workflow

- A repository seperate from master (e.g. development) is where code is pushed by team members.
- Master branch won't have broken code as it would be detected in the development repository first.
